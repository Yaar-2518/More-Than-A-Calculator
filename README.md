## How to Use

To start using the calculator, you need to run the `main()` function. This will open up a menu with all the options listed above.

```python
main()
```

## Math Operations

### Addition
Adds two numbers together.
```python
def add(x, y):
    return x + y
```

### Subtraction
Subtracts the second number from the first number.
```python
def sub(x, y):
    return x - y
```

### Multiplication
Multiplies two numbers together.
```python
def multiply(x, y):
    return x * y
```

### Division
Divides the first number by the second number.
```python
def divide(x, y):
    return x / y
```

### Floor Division
Divides the first number by the second number and rounds down.
```python
def floordiv(x, y):
    return x // y
```

### Power of
Raises the first number to the power of the second number.
```python
def power(x, y):
    return x ** y
```

## Math Formulas

Learn and understand different math formulas with examples! Here are the formulas you can explore:

1. \((a + b)^2\)
2. \((a - b)^2\)
3. \((a + b)(a - b)\)
4. \(a^2 - b^2\)
5. \((a + b)^3\)
6. \((a - b)^3\)
7. \(a^3 + b^3\)
8. \(a^3 - b^3\)
9. \(a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc\)

### Example Formulas

Each formula has a function that shows how it works with examples:

- **Formula 1:** \((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\)
    ```python
    def f1(x, y):
        ...
    ```
- **Formula 2:** \((a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2\)
    ```python
    def f2(x, y):
        ...
    ```
- **Formula 3:** \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\)
    ```python
    def f3(x, y):
        ...
    ```
- **Formula 4:** \(a^2 - b^2 = (a+b)(a-b)\)
    ```python
    def f4(x, y):
        ...
    ```
- **Formula 5:** \((a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3\)
    ```python
    def f5(x, y):
        ...
    ```
- **Formula 6:** \((a - b)^3 = a^3 - 3a^2b + 3ab^2 - b^3\)
    ```python
    def f6(x, y):
        ...
    ```
- **Formula 7:** \(a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)\)
    ```python
    def f7(x, y):
        ...
    ```
- **Formula 8:** \(a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)\)
    ```python
    def f8(x, y):
        ...
    ```
- **Formula 9:** \(a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - bc - ca)\)
    ```python
    def f9(x, y, z):
        ...
    ```
